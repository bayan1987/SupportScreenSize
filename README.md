To get a Git project into your build:

Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file (Gradle)

Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

	allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
		}
	}
  
Step 2. Add the dependency in app/build.gradle

	dependencies {
	        compile 'com.github.hosamazzam:SupportScreenSize:v1.0.2'
	}
